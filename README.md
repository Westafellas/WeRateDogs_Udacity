# Data Wrangling of WeRateDogs by Chinelo Okafor

## Introduction

The dataset I wrangled for this project is WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates peopleâ€™s dogs with a humorous comment about dogs. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 19. However, the rating is sometimes greater than 10, because, the dogs are good dogs. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international coverage.
